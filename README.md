#Input: 
Accept video files (MP4, AVI, MOV). Handle scenes with and without phone usage.

Detection: Identify handheld phones (in hand, on lap, near face). Ignore unrelated objects.

Output: Video with bounding boxes and confidence labels. Maintain the same resolution & FPS as input. Preserve original audio

Performance: Handle partial occlusions. Ignore static phones (e.g., lying on a table). Process near real-time

Optional Enhancements: Log timestamps of phone usage. Generate a summary report.


Out of Scope: Detecting other distractions (books, tablets). Real-time streaming (unless specified). Multi-person tracking (unless required)
# Yes, we can customise as we need.

âœ…Success Criteria
-Bounding boxes appear only for active phone usage
-No false positives
-Smooth playback

#Custom training  detection model and epochs only 50, and input data size only 23 images 
and labelling using the labelling tool
